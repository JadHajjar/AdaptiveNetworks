- transition flags?
- drop downs
- fix the gap (skew lane if junction is not straight)
- lane/track connect groups (might take time)
- manual update of roads needed in asset editor.

tracks:
    - why do I need to refresh roads 2 times on load?
    - why source segment for lane transition is different for forward/backward lane.

-----------------
- automatically add buttons in road editor panels.
- do not modify model selection panels from other editors.
----------------------------
version 4:
    - export/import road xml.
    - patch AssetImporterAssetTemplate.RefreshCoroutine() to speed up prop model loading time
        micro-benchmark UIComponent.Find<T>(string) to see how much time they take up
    - check track's node/segment flags at segment's/node's : start/end/both (on demand if somebody ask for this feature)
    - auto train track maker.
    - generate AR props for vanilla roads.
    - elevations:
        - add
        - share elevations.
        - change
    - anti distortion for crossings
    - height offset for node/segment meshes.
