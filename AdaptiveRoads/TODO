- lane/track templates
- smartCustomFlags for templates
- fix the gap (skew lane if junction is not straight)
- parking props on lane

- optimizations:
    - remove default metadata in game
    - flag for simpler props to avoid further checks.

----------------------------
version 4:
    - elevations:
        - share elevations.
        - alternate elevations based on segment flags required/forbidden
    - export/import road xml.
    - patch AssetImporterAssetTemplate.RefreshCoroutine() to speed up prop model loading time
        micro-benchmark UIComponent.Find<T>(string) to see how much time they take up
    - check track's node/segment flags at segment's/node's : start/end/both (on demand if somebody ask for this feature)
    - auto train track maker.
    - generate AR props for vanilla roads.
    - anti distortion for crossings
    - vertical offset for node/segment meshes.
